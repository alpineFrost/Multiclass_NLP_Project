# Multiclass_NLP_Project
This project is part of the Machine Learning course I had taken in my 5th semester. We were provided with an imaginary entity - CodeProject; a community of software developers. Where members from all over the world come together to share code, tutorials, and knowledge for free to help their fellow software developers.

A scenario was given - CodeProject’s forums are being overrun with spam questions from beginners. The
amount of spam on the website is more than can be manually filtered through. We were to create a model, which, when given various details about a question and the account can predict whether the question should be deleted, and also predict the reason for deletion (from a small set of standard
reasons i.e multiclass classification).

The classes for the target are:
• 0: ”valid”,
• 1: ”kehna kya chahte ho”
• 2: ”irrelevant”
• 3: ”low quality”
• 4: ”not reproducible”

Using several concepts taught in class and also by reading multiple papers on the different models and techniques we could use, we created a classifier with the ultimate goal of detecting spam questions.

This project was done in collaboration with <a href="https://github.com/Vaibhavi1707">@Vaibhavi1707</a>
